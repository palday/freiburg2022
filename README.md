# Statistics Workshop "Modelling Diversity in Language and Cognition"


> Real-world data present a number of challenges for data analysis.
> Simulation provides a way to examine the impact of the quirks of real-world data on your analysis. 
> In this tutorial, I will introduce simulation with mixed models as a tool for planning your analysis (e.g.,
power analysis) and as a way to re-consider your plan after contact
with real-world data (e.g., what impact does imbalance in my sample have on
my inferences?). 
> Simulation and real-world data analysis should not be rivals, but rather partners in inference.
